# Kickstarting-With-Excel-Project
## How different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals
### Purpose
Louise has a play *Fever* that was able to come to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. She wants to know how other Kickstarter campaigns did in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was conducted by pulling together data from other kickstarter projects to see if we could find any determining factors in what leads to a project to reach its goal. Using the *Kickstarter* tab of the File [Kickstarter_Challenge](https://github.com/Andrew-E-Walters/Kickstarting-With-Excel-Project/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx) the data of *Category and Subcategory* was broken out into two seperate colums. With that we were then able to filter our data to the Parent Catagories and Subcategories that were relevant. The next step in the Analysis was to determine how we would sort the data. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first way that we filtered the data was on the Parent Category *Theater*. After we filted to Theater, we then split that data into 3 cloums, Successful, Failed, and Cancelled. Then that data was displayed on a month by month basis to see what impact the Launch date had.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The next way we wanted to analyze the data was by looking at the outcome of a Kickstarter project based on the fundrasing goal. Each Kickstarter has its own Goal of $ that it is trying to achive. The data was filtred by looking at the count of each outcome based on the goal amount. The goal amount was broken out into increments of $5000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered 
There were some challenges and difficulties encountered in this Kickstarter project. One challenge was to determine what ways the data should be looked at. If the data we looked at did not give any insight into what leads to a Kickstarts success or failure then it was of little to no use.
