# Kickstarting-With-Excel-Project
## How different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals
### Purpose
Louise has a play *Fever* that was able to come to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. She wants to know how other Kickstarter campaigns did in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was conducted by pulling together data from other kickstarter projects to see if we could find any determining factors in what leads to a project to reach its goal. Using the *Kickstarter* tab of the [File Kickstarter_Challenge](https://github.com/Andrew-E-Walters/Kickstarting-With-Excel-Project/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx) the data of *Category and Subcategory* was broken out into two seperate colums. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
