# Kickstarting-With-Excel-Project
## How different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals
### Purpose
Louise has a play *Fever* that was able to come to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. She wants to know how other Kickstarter campaigns did in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was conducted by pulling together data from other kickstarter projects to see if we could find any determining factors in what leads to a project to reach its goal. Using the *Kickstarter* tab of the File [Kickstarter_Challenge](https://github.com/Andrew-E-Walters/Kickstarting-With-Excel-Project/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx) the data of *Category and Subcategory* was broken out into two seperate colums. With that we were then able to filter our data to the Parent Catagories and Subcategories that were relevant. The next step in the Analysis was to determine how we would sort the data. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first way that we filtered the data was on the Parent Category *Theater*. After we filted to Theater, we then split that data into 3 cloums, Successful, Failed, and Cancelled. Then that data was displayed on a month by month basis to see what impact the Launch date had.

## Comments on Graph
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The next way we wanted to analyze the data was by looking at the outcome of a Kickstarter project based on the fundrasing goal. Each Kickstarter has its own Goal of $ that it is trying to achive. The data was filtred by looking at the count of each outcome based on the goal amount. The goal amount was broken out into increments of $5000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered 
There were some challenges and difficulties encountered in this Kickstarter project. One challenge was to determine what ways the data should be looked at. If the data we looked at did not give any insight into what leads to a Kickstarts success or failure then it was of little to no use. A difficulty we could have encountered would have been a lack of data. If the data set of plays was only ten plays it would have been harder to difinitively say how Kickstarter plays Succeed or Fail based on their goal. 
## Results
### Conclusions on Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
By Looking at the Graph it seems that May is the best month to start a Kickstarter project seeing as how the largest number of successful outcomes happened in that month. However when looking at the successful plays as a percentage of the total projects launched that month we see that 66.8% of plays lauched in May were successful but the average % of successful plays for the year was 61.2%. While that 66.8% is the highest success rate of any month, the way the data is portrayed in the graph is misleading. May, June, and July do have the highest success rates but it is by roughly 2-5% more than the yearly average. 
### Conculsions on Outcomes based on Goals
When looking at the outcome of plays based on the goals we see two things. Plays have a high success rate (*Above 70%*) when the goal amount is less than or equal to $4999. The other takeaway is that plays have a low success rate (*less than 20%*) when the goal ammount is more than $49,999. There was a mixed success rate in the $5,000 - $49,999 range. There are some limitations with this data that I will discuss in the next section. 
### Limitations of the Dataset
WHen looking at the outcomes based on goals it was easy to confidently discuss the outcome success rate based on goals for plays with a smaller goal budget. This was becasuse there was hundreds of plays that had a goal that was less than $5,000. In contrast, there was only 20 projects total that had a goal at or above $40,000. While there was a clear higher ratio of failures to successes in that goal range, the conclusion was backed up with less data. 
### Possible Tables / Graphs not inculded 
There are some tables and graphs not inculded that might have been able to give more insight into what drives Success or Failures for Kickstarter projects. We looked at the *plays* subcategory of Theater. Within the Theater parent category is *musicals* and *spaces*. If we were to compare the failure and success rates of those subcategories based on launch date and fundraising goals it might give more insight. If we were to see the same trend in fundraising goals success rates with musicals and spaces then it would strengthen our conclusions.
